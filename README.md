Hey there,

Simple Netflix front end

Tools used --- axios / movie-trailer / react-youtube / react

Third party movie provider ---  tmdb https://www.themoviedb.org/

Create a API key in settings -- API -- Create

then go through docs and choose the kind of movies and genre to include.

I may add backend too -- hope I will.
